💫 Hi 👋, I'm SAMARTH 
A passionate  || ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING STUDENT

Email 👉 ✉️ msamarth886@gmail.com

🔭 I’m an aspiring EV Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong interest in how software, electronics, and energy systems come together inside an electric vehicle. I enjoy working at the intersection of battery management, CAN communication, motor control, and embedded firmware, especially using the ESP32 and ESP-IDF stack.

Over the past months, I’ve been building hands-on projects to strengthen my understanding of real EV systems. This includes a CAN-based BMS monitoring setup, an ESP32-driven BLDC motor controller, a small FreeRTOS-based VCU prototype, and several experiments with high-accuracy voltage/current sensing and safety logic like OV, UV, OT, and OC protection. These projects have helped me understand how EV subsystems communicate, stay safe, and operate reliably.

I’m currently deepening my knowledge through certifications in EV technology (NPTEL), BMS, CAN bus, Functional Safety, ESP32 development, and MATLAB for EV systems. I enjoy learning continuously and applying what I learn directly in my projects.

My goal is to work with teams building electric vehicles, battery systems, motor controllers, chargers, or automotive ECUs, where I can contribute to real-world EV innovation while growing as an engineer.
